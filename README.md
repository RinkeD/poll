### Use
1. Clone source
2. `npm run server`
3. Browse to `http://localhost:80`
4. Poll away!


### Tech used (so far)
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
* [poll](https://github.com/opensoars/ezlog)
* [cls](https://github.com/opensoars/cls)
* HTML5


### Note
A new way of testing the RESTful API should b included in the project! Since [Travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/) is having a hard time testing it. It isn't able to make requests to the server. I got to look into this!
